### The spec: 
 - You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a  command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
 - Deposits, withdrawal.
 - Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
 - Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).
